Probable Engine is a piece of web-based rental control software.

Items have multiple reservations, defining the days and users they are reserved for.
Items have 1 type, each type having its own associated daily fee.
Users belong to 1 department, which has the list of items types available for rental to those users.

Admin users can create, edit, and delete users, items, item types, departments, and handle individual user/group permissions.

The home page shows a calendar view of the current users reservations, and can be used to view item availability and if the user is an admin, all existing reservations.
